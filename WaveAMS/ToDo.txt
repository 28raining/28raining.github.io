3. Add arrows
-- add bent arrow option, with slide bar for how bent
-- add text box in middle of arrow
-- redraw control panel on arrow delete
-- change arrow color

- modify text color and sizes

- Increase the canvas resolution by 4x. ALMOST DONE< SCALE IS NOT WORKING

- Add analog waveforms. Just do one for now, then finish up the other tasks
-- SIN, can be phase shifted to COS
-- Linear
-- X^2
-- 1/X

- Can swap some innerHTML for appendchild? Also append classes rather than modify style?

- Arrows NEED to snap to I think, to the lines. This could just be rounding on the x-scale. On the y-scale, maybe have an option to snap it to 25%, 50%, 75%?

- not all arrow is highlighted. And the opacity goes down when arrow is added, because missing a storke or start pth?


4. Remove individual shapes

5. make the waveform pretty, incl 100% opacity and nice borders
-- copy wavedrom, add x-axis dividers. Make them variable somehow
-- Allow color choise of strokes
-- Add annotations



1. When a parameter is changed in the control panel then use that parameter as the default for the future
4. getElementById is slow, I read that somewhere, so try to minimize the number of times it is called
5. Draw a nice control panel

At the end of this I need to:
1. Add undo option to everything, and add a redo option. (at this point, probably easiest to try and copy the data structure I'm sure, than making specific undo for each new option)
2. Add redo option
3. Look up all DOM's at time 0. Also minimize DOM lookups
4. When an error message pops up then clear the canvas. Not working at the moment
5. Save the data to a cookie and automatically reload it on entrance
6. debug the loading time without discuss. Make sure using all teh CDN's
7. Add logical expressions?
8. Save their work in a cookie?
