-- Stop the squashing of the canvas
-- Add font selector for arrow font
Move canvas to top

4. modify text color and sizes

3. Add arrows
-- add bent arrow option, with slide bar for how bent
-- redraw control panel on arrow delete
-- change arrow color

-- Add a slider for the phase of the sine wave



5. Make the drag bars highter

- Add analog waveforms. Just do one for now, then finish up the other tasks
-- Linear
-- X^2
-- 1/X

- Can swap some innerHTML for appendchild? Also append classes rather than modify style?

- Arrows NEED to snap to I think, to the lines. This could just be rounding on the x-scale. On the y-scale, maybe have an option to snap it to 25%, 50%, 75%?

- Clicking on the canvas causes a redraw 5 times. Woops!

- make the drag bars easier to grab, may need to make them taller and have another div inside with the border. Also fix the height scaling

4. Remove individual shapes

5. make the waveform pretty, incl 100% opacity and nice borders
-- copy wavedrom, add x-axis dividers. Make them variable somehow
-- Allow color choise of strokes
-- Add annotations



1. When a parameter is changed in the control panel then use that parameter as the default for the future
4. getElementById is slow, I read that somewhere, so try to minimize the number of times it is called
5. Draw a nice control panel

At the end of this I need to:
1. Add undo option to everything, and add a redo option. (at this point, probably easiest to try and copy the data structure I'm sure, than making specific undo for each new option)
2. Add redo option
3. Look up all DOM's at time 0. Also minimize DOM lookups
4. When an error message pops up then clear the canvas. Not working at the moment
5. Save the data to a cookie and automatically reload it on entrance
6. debug the loading time without discuss. Make sure using all teh CDN's
7. Add logical expressions?
8. Save their work in a cookie?
2.5. Modify row height with a slider in th emain canvas tab?
