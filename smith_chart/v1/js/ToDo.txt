- Number boxes on firefox and edge have tiny up and down arrows, try fix?

- move the text boxes to somewhere not blocked by the line
- text boxes are still using global variables!?
- Verify the span still works with stubs
- make a test document for the smith tool, compare it to s/w tool
- add ability to import s paramitors, the microwave website detailed how this works. Can also use fritzels help document and also I found another website from that rf tools page
-change number box to text box for more area
- span is not working on stub. because using wavelength?
-I've seen nicer discus layouts. maybe they have less console errors too? look for new
