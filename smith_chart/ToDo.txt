NOT GOING TO DO - 3 - Add a s-parameter to impedance converter

DONE - 1 - Add tolerances to components
DONE - 2 - Plot S-parameters (= 1+R / 1-R)
DONE - 4 - Add a frequency vs impedance imput option
DONE:- Save modal will save the data to the custom components
DONE: - Next time modal is opened it is auto-populated
DONE:- button for S&H or linear
DONE:- plot graph of Z vs F
DONE:- Add form validation to make sure input contains only numbers,spaces,commas and e or E
DONE - Update function update_schem_component
DONE: -deal with blank line at end of input

//TODO - A big improvement here would be to separate out the impedance calculation and arc drawing. It should calculate impedances, then calculate points along the arc
//also could use a complex number function for all the math

1 - Add arrows / sliders next to the values for small tweaking of the numbers
2 - In custom impedance markers, also show the reflection Coefficient and VSWR

--draw2d issues
- grid no scroll
- can't connect ports together
- can't select stuff
- select multiple and drag


[-] - Move calculateMNA into a useMemo - not worth it for now
[x] Move bilinear into a click-button - it's adding 80+ms of time each render
[x] Toast if user tries to add 2 v sources
[x] - Toast after copying latex for example viewing page. Make MathML viewer and direct there
[x] - tooltips
[x] - fix issue when current is connected directly to vout thru 1 resistor
