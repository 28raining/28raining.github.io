CONE - 1 - Add tolerances to components
2 - Plot S-parameters (= 1+R / 1-R)
3 - Add a s-parameter to impedance converter
4 - Add a frequency vs impedance imput option

//TODO - A big improvement here would be to separate out the impedance calculation and arc drawing. It should calculate impedances, then calculate points along the arc
//also could use a complex number function for all the math
