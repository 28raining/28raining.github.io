1 - Draw a static RC filter
2 - Show laplace equation
-- Draw the laplace in Latex
-- Add 3 nodes (currently only support 2 nodes)
-- Add op-amps with R feedback
-- Add user drawing capability
-- Verify laplace is working by testing with big LC filter


-- Below is done later, after laplace derivation is more thoroughly verified... --
3 - Show bilinear transform equation
4 - Show state space representation
5 - Draw amplitude response of those 3 transforms


# Draw2D
1) ~~Add a resistor shape to toolbar~~
2) ~~Add capacitor shape to toolbar~~
3) ~~allow drag + drop + connect~~
4) ~~extract connection map?~~
5) ~~remove all the other unuesd gubbins (port to main site)~~
6) ~~Add vsource and gnd symbol~~
7) ~~Add a checklist of items which need to be done before laplace is calculated~~
8) ~~Build the MNA matrix~~
9) ~~solve the matrix and display the answer~~
10) 
- STOP - clean up the code! 
- ~~Switch to algebrite -> done - remove nerdamer~~
- ~~Put the code into js modules~~
- ~~Use Preact properly~~
- ~~Displaying latex nicely~~
- ~~Add capacitors~~
- displaying frequency response
- Clean up console logging
- Load a preset schematic
- Launch the beta version on github
10) Remove elements who aren't connected at both ends



# Future ideas
- Site to store tiny pieces of data. So this site can have memory and be severless. And smith chart site
